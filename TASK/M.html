Art is an expression of our thoughts, emotions, intuitions, and desires, but it is even more personal than that: itâ€™s about sharing the way we experience the world, which for many is an extension of personality. It is the communication of intimate concepts that cannot be faithfully portrayed by words alone. And because words alone are not enough, we must find some other vehicle to carry our intent.
